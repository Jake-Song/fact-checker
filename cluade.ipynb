This theorem states that for any two positive coprime integers $a$ and $d$, there are infinitely many primes of the form $a + nd$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.\\n\\nIn our case, we're looking at the arithmetic progression $3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...$ which can be written as $3 + 4n$ for $n \\\\geq 0$. \\n\\nWait, I need to be careful here. $15 = 3 \\\\times 5$ is not a prime number. So the progression isn't $3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...$. Rather, it's the sequence of prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSo the first few such primes are $3, 7, 11, 19, 23, ...$.\\n\\nAnyway, here $a = 3$ and $d = 4$. Since $\\\\gcd(3, 4) = 1$, Dirichlet's theorem tells us that there are infinitely many primes in this arithmetic progression.\\n\\nWait, that's not quite right. Dirichlet's theorem tells us that there are infinitely many primes of the form $3 + 4n$ for $n \\\\geq 0$, i.e., primes that are congruent to $3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSo, yes, there are infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem is asking for prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\\\bmod 4 = 3$. In other words, when $p$ is divided by $4$, the remainder is $3$. That's exactly the condition $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nActually, let me try to prove this directly, without invoking Dirichlet's theorem, since there is a simpler proof for this specific case.\\n\\nI'll use a proof by contradiction. Assume there are only finitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. Let's denote them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nNow, let's define the number $N = 4p_1 p_2 \\\\ldots p_k - 1$.\\n\\nLet's check the remainder when $N$ is divided by $4$:\\n$N \\\\bmod 4 = (4p_1 p_2 \\\\ldots p_k - 1) \\\\bmod 4 = (0 - 1) \\\\bmod 4 = -1 \\\\bmod 4 = 3 \\\\bmod 4$.\\n\\nSo, $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of $N$. $N$ is not divisible by $2$ because $N$ is odd. Additionally, $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$, because dividing $N$ by any of these primes would give a remainder of $-1 \\\\bmod{p_i}$.\\n\\nSo, $N$ is either a prime number itself, or it has at least one prime factor $q$ that is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nIf $N$ is a prime number, then $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ would be a new prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ that is not in our list, which contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nIf $N$ has a prime factor $q$ not in our list, let's think about the congruence of $q$ modulo $4$. Well, I know that if a number is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, then it's odd. But not all odd primes are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. For instance, $5 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nHmm, actually, I've made a mistake in the previous approach. Not all prime factors of $N$ have to be congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. So, this approach might not work directly.\\n\\nActually, let me start again with a different approach.\\n\\nI'll use Euclid's idea of constructing a new prime.\\n\\nSuppose there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and let's call them $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nI'll define $N = 4p_1 p_2 \\\\ldots p_k - 1$.\\n\\nAs we saw earlier, $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nNow, $N$ must have at least one prime factor. Each of these prime factors must be congruent to either $1$ or $3$ modulo $4$ (since $2$ is the only even prime and clearly doesn't divide $N$).\\n\\nBut, none of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ (which are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$) can divide $N$, as dividing $N$ by any of them would give a remainder of $-1$.\\n\\nThis means that $N$ either is a prime itself or has prime factors that are congruent to $1$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nActually, wait. I need to be more careful here. If $N$ has prime factors that are congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, can the product of such primes give a number that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$?\\n\\nLet me check: If $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\pmod{4} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nActually, the property I'm looking for is: if $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSimilarly, if $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 3 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\pmod{4} \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{4} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nIf $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\pmod{4} \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSo, if a number is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, then it must have an odd number of prime factors that are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nSince $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, and none of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ can divide $N$, there must be at least one prime factor of $N$ that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ and is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nWait, I think I made an error. Let me just double-check the arithmetic.\\n\\nIf $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 3 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\equiv 9 \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$. This is correct.\\n\\nOops, I need to be more explicit about the contradiction.\\n\\nIf $N = 4p_1 p_2 \\\\ldots p_k - 1$ has a prime factorization where all primes are congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $N$ itself would be congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. But we found that $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. This means $N$ must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nSince $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$, this new prime is not in our list. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nLet me try a different, potentially cleaner approach:\\n\\nI'll use the following property: If a number is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, then it must have at least one prime factor that is also congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nProof of the property: Let $n \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. In the prime factorization of $n$, each prime is either $2$ or an odd prime. Odd primes are either congruent to $1$ or $3$ modulo $4$.\\n   \\n   - $2$ is congruent to $2$ modulo $4$.\\n   - If $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n   - If $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n   - If $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nFrom the above, we can see that for a number to be congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, it must have an odd power of $2$ (if it has any) and an odd number of primes that are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. But an odd power of $2$ would make the number even, and $3$ is odd. So, $n$ must have an odd number (at least one) of prime factors that are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nNow, to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, I'll use a contradiction.\\n\\nAssume there are only finitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, and let's list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nConsider the number $N = 4p_1 p_2 \\\\ldots p_k - 1$.\\n\\nClearly, $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nFrom the property proven above, $N$ must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. But $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ (as dividing $N$ by any of them leaves a remainder of $-1$).\\n\\nThis means there's another prime factor of $N$, say $q$, that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ and is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nActually, I think I still haven't been perfectly clear on why $N$ must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. Let me try to be precise.\\n\\nIf a number is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, its prime factorization must have prime factors. Each prime factor (except for $2$) is either congruent to $1$ or $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nIf all prime factors of $N$ were congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $N$ itself would be congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. This contradicts $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nIf all prime factors of $N$ were equal to $2$ or congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $N$ would be either congruent to a power of $2$ modulo $4$ (which can be $0$, $1$, or $2$, but not $3$) or a product of powers where some factors are $2$ and others are congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. Such a product cannot be congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nTherefore, $N$ must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nHmm, let me approach from first principles to be sure.\\n\\nWe know that every prime number other than $2$ is odd. And any odd number, when divided by $4$, can give a remainder of $1$ or $3$.\\n\\nLet's investigate the modular arithmetic:\\n\\nIf $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\nIf $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 9 \\\\pmod{4} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\nIf $p \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ and $q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, then $pq \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nThe prime $2$ is in a class by itself. $2 \\\\equiv 2 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nAlso, $2 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\equiv 4 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{4}$, and $2 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\equiv 2 \\\\pmod{4}$, and $2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\equiv 6 \\\\equiv 2 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nSo, for a number to be congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, it cannot have a factor of $2$ (it must be odd), and it must have an odd number of prime factors that are congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nWith these properties, we can now apply Euclid's method. Assume there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nLet's define $M = p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k$.\\n\\nWe have $M \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{4}$ or $M \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$ depending on whether $k$ is even or odd.\\n\\nLet's define $N = 4M - 1$.\\n\\nThen, $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\n$N$ must have at least one prime factor congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. But it can't be any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ because $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p_i}$ for every $i$.\\n\\nSo, there must be a new prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ that divides $N$. But this contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nLet me do a more straightforward application of the property:\\n\\nAssume there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nConsider the number $Q = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 + 3$. We have $Q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nQ must have at least one prime factor congruent to $3$ modulo $4$. This prime is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ because for each $i$, we have $Q \\\\cong 3 \\\\pmod{p_i}$. (This is because $p_i$ certainly divides $(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$, so it divides $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$. Thus, $Q \\\\cong 3 \\\\pmod{p_i}$. Since $p_i > 3$ for $i > 1$ (since $p_1 = 3$), and $p_1 \\\\ne 3$ (because $3 \\\\cong 3 \\\\pmod{4}$),  we know that $p_i$ doesn't divide $3$. If $p_i$ divided $Q$, it would have to divide $3$, which is a contradiction. So, $p_i$ doesn't divide $Q$.) \\n\\nWait, I think I made a slight error. $p_1$ could be $3$ since $3 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. Let's adjust:\\n\\nAssume there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ where $p_1 = 3$ (the smallest odd prime).\\n\\nConsider the number $Q = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 + 3$. We have $Q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nFor $i = 1$ (i.e., for $p_1 = 3$), we have $Q \\\\equiv 4((p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2) + 3 \\\\equiv 0 + 3 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{3}$. Since $3$ divides $3$, $p_1$ divides $Q$.\\n\\nActually, wait. Let's just go with a slightly different construction:\\n\\nAssume there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ where $p_1 = 3$.\\n\\nConsider the number $Q = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 - 1$. We have $Q \\\\equiv -1 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nFor each $i$, we have $Q \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p_i}$ (because $p_i$ divides $(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$, so it divides $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$, and thus $Q \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p_i}$). Since $p_i$ divides $Q - 1$, $p_i$ does not divide $Q$.\\n\\nThus, $Q$ has a prime factor congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ that is not on our list. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nOne last attempt to simplify the proof:\\n\\nLet me try to use the property about odd numbers modulo 4 more directly (odd numbers are either congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4) in the proof:\\n\\nAssume there are only finitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nConsider the number: $N = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k) - 1$.\\n\\nWe have $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, which means $N$ is an odd number congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nFor $N$ to be congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, it must have at least one prime factor that is also congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ (because a product of primes congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ is itself congruent to $1$ modulo $4$).\\n\\nBut $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ (because for each $i$, $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p_i}$, indicating that $p_i$ doesn't divide $N$).\\n\\nSo, $N$ must have a prime factor congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ that is not in our list. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nActually, let me fix this for a final time:\\n\\nIf $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ are all the primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, consider the number $N = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 - 1$.\\n\\nSince each $p_i$ is odd, their product is odd, and the square of an odd number is odd. So, $(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$ is odd.\\n\\nMultiplying by $4$, we get an even number, $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$. Subtracting $1$, we get $N$, which is odd.\\n\\nNow, $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nFor each $i$, $p_i$ divides $(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$, so it divides $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$. Thus, $N \\\\equiv -1 \\\\pmod{p_i}$. This means $p_i$ doesn't divide $N$.\\n\\nSo, $N$ must have a prime factor $q$ that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ and is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nYeah, I think that's a correct and pretty clear proof.\\n\\nAlthough, I should make one small clarification on why $N$ must have a prime factor $q$ that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nSince $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$, it's odd. In the prime factorization of $N$, each prime is odd (because $N$ is odd). Odd primes are either congruent to $1$ or $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nIf all prime factors of $N$ were congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $N$ itself would be congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ (because a product of numbers congruent to $1$ modulo $4$ is itself congruent to $1$ modulo $4$). But we've determined that $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. This means $N$ must have at least one prime factor congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nThis prime factor can't be any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$ because, as we've shown, $p_i$ doesn't divide $N$ for any $i$.\\n\\nSo, $N$ must have a prime factor $q$ that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ and is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nTo give a coherent and clean answer:\\n\\nYes, there are infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\\n\\nLet's prove this by contradiction. Suppose there are only finitely many such primes. Let's list them as $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$.\\n\\nConsider the number $N = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 - 1$.\\n\\nWe can check that $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. \\n\\nAlso, for each $i$, $p_i$ divides $(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$, which means $p_i$ divides $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$. Thus, when we divide $4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2$ by $p_i$, the remainder is $0$. So, when we divide $N = 4(p_1 \\\\cdot p_2 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot p_k)^2 - 1$ by $p_i$, the remainder is $-1$ (or equivalently, $p_i - 1$). This means $N$ is not divisible by any of the $p_i$.\\n\\nNow, $N$ is odd. If it had a prime factorization where all primes were congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, then $N$ itself would be congruent to $1$ modulo $4$. But we've shown $N \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$. This means $N$ must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to $3$ modulo $4$.\\n\\nSince $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_k$, this prime factor is a new prime congruent to $3$ modulo $4$ that is not in our list. This contradicts our assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p \\\\equiv 3 \\\\pmod{4}$.\", type='thinking'), TextBlock(citations=None, text=\"# Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?\\n\\nYes, there are infinitely many prime numbers p such that p ≡ 3 (mod 4).\\n\\nI'll prove this by contradiction, using a method similar to Euclid's classic proof of the infinitude of primes.\\n\\n## Proof:\\n\\nSuppose there are only finitely many primes congruent to 3 modulo 4.
